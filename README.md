## implementation of the original [yolo paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640.pdf) on pytorch

python version: Python 3.10.6

the model needs to be trained on the [PASCAL VOC dataset](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/)
you have to extract the dataset in the main directory and run the split_data script

### Note that [tensorboard](https://pypi.org/project/tensorboard/) also needs to be installed
